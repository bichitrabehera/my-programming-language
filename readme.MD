# Custom Code Runner & Mini Programming Language

A web-based code editor & runner that supports a custom programming language with basic operations.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Custom Code Editor** – Write and execute code in real-time  
✅ **Mini Programming Language** – Supports basic arithmetic operations & output printing  
✅ **English-like Syntax** – Uses `yeh` for variable declaration and `dikha` for output  
✅ **Dark Theme UI** – Aesthetic and easy on the eyes  
✅ **Lexer & Parser Implementation** – Converts custom code into JavaScript and executes it

## 💡 How It Works

### 🔹 Custom Language Syntax
```txt
yeh x = 10
yeh y = 20
dikha x + y
```
- `yeh x = 10` → Declares a variable `x` with value `10`  
- `dikha x + y` → Prints the sum of `x` and `y`  

### ✅ Supported Operations
✔️ Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
✔️ Multiple print statements
